# [Project 1] Car Recall Data Analysis
## Project Goals
- Analysis of vehicle defect recall data from Korea Transportation Safety Authority to derive meaningful information
- Learning data purification, feature engineering, and visualization methods to perform exploratory data analysis
## Project Outline 
Recall is a consumer protection system in which the seller repairs, inspects, and exchanges free of charge when defects are found in the design and manufacturing stages of the product to prevent problems. As each house has a personal car, automobiles have become a part of our daily lives. However, sporadic concerns about safety continue to be raised, and as a result, sudden car recalls often occur, attracting attention.

In this project, we will use the 2020 automobile defect recall data provided by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority to discover and visualize meaningful patterns and insights.

# [Project 2] COVID-19 Data Analysis
## Project Goals
- Analysis of data on the status of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Seoul to derive meaningful information
- Learning data purification, feature engineering, and visualization methods to perform exploratory data analysis
## Project Outline
The COVID-19 virus, which occurred in early 2020, was a global pandemic, and a lot of analysis is being done about it. In the early days of the epidemic, there was not enough data to analyze it, but now, after more than 6 months, various data institutions are publicly providing corona-related data.

In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis based on the 'Seoul Corona 19 confirmed cases' data provided by the domestic public data portal. We selected the data of Seoul, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the largest number of people among domestic data.

# [Project 3] Gas station market analysis with oil price data
## Project Goals
- Deriving insights related to the gas station market by analyzing the price/region/brand/self of the <Korea National Oil Corporation gas station sales price by product> data
- Learn about essential analysis processes and techniques used in actual research/practice
## Project outline
The ‘KNOC Gas Station Sales Price by Product’, which is registered on the public data portal of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, provides vast data such as price/region/brand/self-service for more than 10,000 gas stations across the country. Let's analyze this data from the perspective of an oil refiner's strategic planning team executives to derive insights into the gas station market.

First, let's process the data for each year so that there is one row for each gas station by summarizing the data accumulated by 7 days for each gas station. And using this data, let's analyze how many gas stations have opened and closed in the past 4 years. Next, let's analyze price competitiveness by brand and changes in market share over the past 4 years. Lastly, let's find out how much the price difference is by gas station and analyze whether there are any significant differences by region.
