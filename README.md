# [Project 1] Car Recall Data Analysis
## Project Goals
- Analysis of vehicle defect recall data from Korea Transportation Safety Authority to derive meaningful information
- Learning data purification, feature engineering, and visualization methods to perform exploratory data analysis
## Project Outline 
Recall is a consumer protection system in which the seller repairs, inspects, and exchanges free of charge when defects are found in the design and manufacturing stages of the product to prevent problems. As each house has a personal car, automobiles have become a part of our daily lives. However, sporadic concerns about safety continue to be raised, and as a result, sudden car recalls often occur, attracting attention.

In this project, we will use the 2020 automobile defect recall data provided by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority to discover and visualize meaningful patterns and insights.

# [Project 2] COVID-19 Data Analysis
## Project Goals
- Analysis of data on the status of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Seoul to derive meaningful information
- Learning data purification, feature engineering, and visualization methods to perform exploratory data analysis
## Project Outline
The COVID-19 virus, which occurred in early 2020, was a global pandemic, and a lot of analysis is being done about it. In the early days of the epidemic, there was not enough data to analyze it, but now, after more than 6 months, various data institutions are publicly providing corona-related data.

In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis based on the 'Seoul Corona 19 confirmed cases' data provided by the domestic public data portal. We selected the data of Seoul, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the largest number of people among domestic data.

# [Project 3] Gas station market analysis with oil price data
## Project Goals
- Deriving insights related to the gas station market by analyzing the price/region/brand/self of the <Korea National Oil Corporation gas station sales price by product> data
- Learn about essential analysis processes and techniques used in actual research/practice
## Project outline
The ‘KNOC Gas Station Sales Price by Product’, which is registered on the public data portal of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, provides vast data such as price/region/brand/self-service for more than 10,000 gas stations across the country. Let's analyze this data from the perspective of an oil refiner's strategic planning team executives to derive insights into the gas station market.

First, let's process the data for each year so that there is one row for each gas station by summarizing the data accumulated by 7 days for each gas station. And using this data, let's analyze how many gas stations have opened and closed in the past 4 years. Next, let's analyze price competitiveness by brand and changes in market share over the past 4 years. Lastly, let's find out how much the price difference is by gas station and analyze whether there are any significant differences by region.
  
# [Project 4] Subway Passenger Analysis
## Project Goals
- To check the number of passengers at the station at the time of boarding or alighting, **data on the number of passengers passing through the ticket gate** and **data on the subway location coordinates**
- Learning data purification, feature engineering, and visualization methods to perform exploratory data analysis 
## Project Outline
You may have gotten used to the situation of the corona virus, but sometimes when you go out, you want to avoid crowded places, so you may want to know which places to avoid. If you check the number of passengers using the subway, you can identify areas with high levels of congestion.

In this project, let's analyze the 'Information on the number of people getting on and off at each station by subway line in Seoul' provided by the Seoul Open Data Plaza and intuitively check which station on a specific line is the most crowded by using the 'Subway station location coordinates' data.

# [Project 5] Prediction of product recommendation through review analysis of clothing sales
## Key Words  
Word cloud, Visualization, Natural language, ML, Decision tree, Confusion matrix  
## Project Goals
- Perform a classification model to predict whether a product will be recommended through product review data analysis
- Perform data analysis on characteristic data that affects product recommendation
## Project outline
As the era of untact approaches, various products such as clothing, groceries, and electronic products have been traded through the Internet. Numerous products are displayed on the Internet, but it is difficult to know if a product is right for you unless you have actually used it. In order to overcome these shortcomings, numerous e-commerce websites allow users to leave product reviews and encourage as many reviews as possible. Through these reviews, consumers can get information that they could not understand from actual reviews and product information, and they can also have trust for products with many positive reviews. From a seller's point of view, a product with many reviews can be used as a marketing element, and it has the advantage of being able to listen to consumers' opinions. Therefore, in e-commerce, reviews are valuable as characteristic data that is very important for purchasing products.

In this project, we implement a classification model that predicts product recommendations based on women's clothing e-commerce data provided by Kaggle. This way, when you receive new reviews and women's clothing information, you can predict whether you would recommend the product. Using this, it is possible to predict whether or not to recommend a product based on reviews and clothing information even for products for which there is no product recommendation, which can be used again as an important product indicator.
