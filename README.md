# [Project 1] Car Recall Data Analysis
Recall is a consumer protection system in which the seller repairs, inspects, and exchanges free of charge when defects are found in the design and manufacturing stages of the product to prevent problems. As each house has a personal car, automobiles have become a part of our daily lives. However, sporadic concerns about safety continue to be raised, and as a result, sudden car recalls often occur, attracting attention.

In this project, we will use the 2020 automobile defect recall data provided by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority to discover and visualize meaningful patterns and insights.

# [Project 2] COVID-19 Data Analysis
The COVID-19 virus, which occurred in early 2020, was a global pandemic, and a lot of analysis is being done about it. In the early days of the epidemic, there was not enough data to analyze it, but now, after more than 6 months, various data institutions are publicly providing corona-related data.

In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis based on the 'Seoul Corona 19 confirmed cases' data provided by the domestic public data portal. We selected the data of Seoul, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the largest number of people among domestic data.
